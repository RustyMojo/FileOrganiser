## Project Goals

1. Automated File Sorting:
   * Detect when a new file is downloaded or created.
   * Categorise files based on file type, name patterns, metadata, and user-defined rules.
   * Move files to designated folders dynamically (e.g., PDFs to 'Documents,' images to 'Pictures,' executables to 'Software').
   * Allow user customisation for sorting rules and folder destinations.
2. Real-Time Monitoring & Automation:
   * Continuously track the Downloads folder and other specified directories.
   * Apply sorting actions immediately when files appear.
   * Provide a history/log of moved files for transparency.
   * Undo functionality for accidental moves.
3. AI-Powered Organisation & Suggestions:
   * Use AI to recognise file content and suggest optimal locations.
   * Identify duplicate files and recommend deletions or merging.
   * Recognise frequently accessed files and suggest shortcuts or quick access placement.
4. Customisable Rules & User Preferences:
   * Allow users to set up custom automation workflows.
   * Support regex-based rules for advanced sorting.
   * Enable priority-based rules (e.g., sort PDFs with "invoice" into the "Finance" folder).
5. Smart Cleanup & Maintenance:
   * Detect and remove unused temporary files.
   * Identify large or old files for archiving.
   * Notify the user about potential storage issues.
6. Intuitive UI & UX:
   * Provide a professional and sleek user interface.
   * Offer drag-and-drop functionality for manual sorting.
   * Include a dashboard for monitoring and managing files.
7. Security & Privacy Considerations:
   * Ensure no unauthorised access to sensitive files.
   * Allow users to exclude certain directories from automation.
